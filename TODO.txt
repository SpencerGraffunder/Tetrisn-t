TODO:
create a useful debug mode to test frame data?

figure out why (with BOARD_WIDTH = 4) 
	sometimes the program crashes due to the direction down code (line 249) not being passed a piece type (it gets passed 'None'). I've found that it happens when holding down on keyboard when the piece is flush right and it clears a line or two, but has also happened with a long piece vertically on column 3 (2 with index by 0). Usually takes some time of playing for it to happen
	hypothesis 1: always on a line clear when going from level 16 to level 17
	hypothesis 1 failed due to a Z piece at rotation 90 being placed on the far right with no line clearing. Similar thing happened with an O piece. Also, once it was 17 to 18.

generalize the display score position and scale

generalize the display level position and scale

fix multiplayer next_piece

make game over

make animation for line clear (20 frames for clear plus the lock delay time all included in the animation)

make colored outlines for active pieces in multiplayer to indicated the player controlling each piece

make main menu
