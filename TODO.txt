TODO:
create a useful debug mode to test frame data?

determine if the fall speed is being correctly implimented (level 0 seems way too fast and level 30 seems way too slow as though it's at 2 and not 1)

figure out why DAS doesn't always tuck pieces correctly and fix it if it's a problem
	probably fixed

figure out why (with BOARD_WIDTH = 4) 
	sometimes the program crashes due to the direction down code (line 249) not being passed a piece type (it gets passed 'None'). I've found that it happens when holding down on keyboard when the piece is flush right and it clears a line or two, but has also happened with a long piece vertically on column 3 (2 with index by 0). Usually takes some time of playing for it to happen
	hypothesis 1: always on a line clear when going from level 16 to level 17
	hypothesis 1 failed due to a Z piece at rotation 90 being placed on the far right with no line clearing. Similar thing happened with an O piece. Also, once it was 17 to 18.
