To get networking going quickly, we'll have two high level phases.
1. All game logic runs on the server
    a. This will cause a lag between when the player takes and action and their screen updpate
    b. It should be simpler because the game state is only on the server
2. Client contains some game logic for prediction
    a. Players will see their actions instantly
    b. Client will need to handle corrections if the players actions conflicted on teh server


We can plan phase 2 later, but for now, phase 1 will require two steps. First,
we will need to completely modulate the client and server. The client will send
all actions taken by the player to the server process, which will update the
game state every tick and send the complete game state back to the client to
draw.

Second, we will need to make this sending of actions over a network connection.
This second step should be a bit easier than the first step.
